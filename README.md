# Password Generator Starter Code
This project was one to test the ability to creat a window prompt, save selections from the user and then generate a password off of a series of random characters. I defined each alphanumeric character and their aplha captilized counterparts. If criteria is not met, user sees "criteria must be met" and has to start over.
